I was already planning to join at least one musical group just to try and have a bit of fun in university. I ended up being in GENUS (Initially wanted to join NUS Wind Symphony but my saxophone was only loaned until the end of JC so I didn\u2019t instrument to do so). However, I didn\u2019t regret the decision to do so and actually enjoyed my time in GENUS a lot so far. Despite some challenges as I didn\u2019t play guitar for 2 years (I played saxophone in JC haha) but, the musical choices and the seniors support actually gave me the motivation to be better every day. Our group may not be as big as NUSSO or NUSWS but, we are a closely-knitted group and despite coming from the various faculties of NUS, we are united by our love and appreciation for guitars. Come and join GENUS to witness how guitar can actually match the strength of an ensemble or even an orchestra and change your view of guitars beyond an individual-based instrument.")),(0,i.kt)("h2",{id:"how-to-sign-up"},"How to Sign Up?"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"We are opening recruitment and hosting open classes for new members to learn more about GENUS.
