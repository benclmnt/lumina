Throughout the entire experience, I have learnt many things from creating a proper proposal to manning an event catered for nearly 900 students at once, as well as coming up with suitable programs to allow Engin Club improve their ability to reach out towards more students. I really enjoyed the experience so far despite the occasional stress sometimes haha but, it was all worth it when you managed to make the Vice Dean of Engineering playing legos during Engin Day as if he was back to his childhood days and how he was really enjoying the programmes I came up with.
