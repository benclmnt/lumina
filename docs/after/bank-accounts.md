A Singapore bank account is a must-have for NUS students. Other than simplifying daily payments and savings, this bank account can be used as a channel for paying tuition fees and receiving financial aid or scholarship funds. 

Due to its ubiquity in and around NUS, the OCBC is recommended. OCBC has a branch in UTown, where you can create a bank account. The process usually takes no more than 15 minutes, and you could also take your debit card directly after you've made your OCBC FRANK Account. Nearest OCBC outside NUS are at Holland Village and Clementi. 

If you prefer DBS, nearest DBS are at Holland Village and Clementi.

You can refer to gothere.sg to find out how to make your way there. You will need to have your **passport** and **NUS offer letter** on hand when you open your bank account. Perhaps, you also need to bring **a proof letter from respective hostel** that provides information that you are indeed a resident in NUS.
