We strongly encourage you to conduct your medical examination in NUS to avoid any unwanted complications and incompatibilities that can arise if you complete the test in Indonesia. It will cost $55 (fifty-five Singapore dollars) for you to get the test done here.

Please do not delay in taking this test, therefore, we recommend you to take it after QET (18 July) on 18th July afternoon and 19th July morning.

Check [here](https://www.gevme.com/nus-pre-admission-medical-examination2) for further info and to book your appointment:

Early booking is essential to get the date you want!
The medical examination will be at the University Health Centre (UHC), NUS (_it’s not in NUH :)_) 

To get there, you can take the NUS internal shuttle bus. For bus lines A1 / D2, alight at the _Opposite University Health Centre_ bus stop while for bus lines A2 / C, alight at the _University Health Centre_ bus stop.

Several things to take note: 
- Bring your documents and items required for the medical checkup. 
- Your passport
- Medical history/reports written in English (if any)
- Cash or NETS card
- [NUS Medical Examination Form :warning: BROKEN LINK](http://www.nus.edu.sg/uhc/images/downloads/Undergraduate.pdf ) with **Part I completed**
- Prescription eyewear / contact lens
- Wear a plain t-shirt or blouse (but if you don’t have one, it’s okay, usually they’ll ask you to wear their disposable X-ray gown anyway).
- **For girls**, please do the medical examination at least 5 to 7 days after the end of your menses, since there will be a urine test. However, if that’s not possible they usually allow you to take the urine test some other time.

One week after your check up, don’t forget to bring your passport and go back to UHC to collect your results :)
