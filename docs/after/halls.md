## General Info and Tips

### Duration
Hall residents are entitled to 1 year of stay. If you want to extend your stay, you should gather points by joining CCAs and take leadership roles in committees. **Points differ for each CCAs depending on the hall focus! **

### Hall Cultures

If you’re into sports, go check out Eusoff or Temasek Hall. If you're into arts / culture, Sheares or Kent Ridge might suit you better. If you want to try hall life but don't wanna miss Indo friends, Raffles Hall has the biggest Indo population compared to other halls

### Reasons **NOT** to stay in halls!

If you are someone who wants to get a more peaceful, toned down and intellectually-driven community, you may want to consider residential colleges instead. If you just want to focus on studying in university and like having your alone time, then PGPR may be the better place for you.

### Dining Experiences

:::caution
Dining experience might differ _slightly_ from hall to hall due to difference in catering provider. Do check with seniors to confirm!

:::tip

1. **Want an extra meal?** Fret not! Simply ask in your block group chat for an extra matric number! Or, you can also wait up to 9PM and be entitled to get another meal yourself with your matric card <br/><br/>
:warning: Unlike the residential colleges, halls do not allow you to keep your meal credits and reuse them another time.

1. **Want larger meal portions?** Quietest on Friday and Sunday nights, since most Singaporeans will go back to their homes to eat, or eat out. So usually on these nights, they will serve larger portions of dinner. Or, if you’re lucky, can simply ask the meal servers to give you an extra scoop of food.

1. People in the block may come out with trumpets and go on knocking on every door to **call you for dinner, watch out!** , but I guess this is how they maintain their closely-knit “family” vibe with one another. <br/><br/>

## [Kent Ridge Hall](http://nus.edu.sg/osa/kentridgehall)

#### Why stay at Kent Ridge Hall?

:::tip
If you are someone who wants to get a taste of hall life, enjoys being active with many CCAs (people here join up to 5 or more!), sleeps late and don’t mind people being rowdy or socializing till late nights, then by all means, go for KR. 
:::

#### Location
Across NUS Business School (~3 mins walk)


#### Culture / Focus
KR is a culture hall, so it's known for its dance and music groups. However, one CCA that separates KR from the rest is “Steppers” - its famed Cheerleading team that has won several international competitions.

 _Note: Joining Steppers will give you the most points among other CCAs, but it’s competitive, and they will really toughen you up with practices until 3AM!_ 

#### People / Community

- There will never be a peaceful day at hall. Either it is your block event or dinner gathering, someone will jio (“invite”) you for supper or go out for drinks/clubs. Or some people may just gather in rooms and chit-chat or grind for exams together. _Note: it is a hall culture to leave your doors open or unlatched, because we are a very open and family-like community_
- More than other halls, KR is known for being the most rabak (“lively”), they are a very vibrant and rowdy community. Expect to still hear voices at 3AM in the morning. Sometimes, it can be pretty exhausting to keep up, but if you’re the rowdy type as well, then KR will be a great family for you.

#### Welfare
1. Recess week and reading week (before midterms and exams): Check out for your block lifts, they will sneak in some goodies in a basket! 
1. You will be greeted by a welfare pack on your first days at KR and also a welcome gift after coming back from a semester. 
1. Along the semester, KR Welfare will treat you to surprise welfare like mala, prata, acai, hotpot… KEEP A LOOKOUT!
