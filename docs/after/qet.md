We strongly recommend you to take QET this July and not to postpone it as it is something that you would want to get over with quickly!

To those who need help, we will provide QET tutoring session on 7 and 14 July 2016. (update required)

Remember to register online via [EDUREC](https://isisregpart1.nus.edu.sg/psc/cs90prd/EMPLOYEE/PSFT_HR/c/N_ADMISSIONS.N_PREREG_LOGIN.GBL?&) from 27 June to 10 July 2017. If you have yet to register by 10 July, you need to wait for the next QET in November 2017.

Upon login, navigate to: Self-Service > Student Centre. Under “Academics” section, click on the “QET/DET Registration” link and follow the instructions for registration. If you are unable to register online, please email [qet@nus.edu.sg](mailto:qet@nus.edu.sg) for assistance.

Detailed information about the QET, including exemption criteria, can be found [here](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-activities/registration/academic-related-matters/qet):

Freshmen who have met the exemption criteria can overlook this step entirely. There is no need to report your fulfillment of the criteria to CELC, so just relax.
