A Singapore bank account is a must-have for NUS students. Other than simplifying daily payments and savings, this bank account can be used as a channel for paying tuition fees and receiving financial aid or scholarship funds. 

Due to its ubiquity in and around NUS, the OCBC is recommended. Nearest OCBC are at Holland Village and Clementi. 

You can refer to gothere.sg to find out how to make your way there. You will need to have your **passport** and **NUS offer letter** on hand when you open your bank account. Perhaps, you also need to bring **a proof letter from respective hostel** that provides information that you are indeed a resident in NUS.
